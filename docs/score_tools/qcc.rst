QCC Compiler Verification Report
================================

Introduction
------------
Scope and purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
QCC (QNX C Compiler) is a C/C++ target compiler from BlackBerry to build software for QNX boards.
It is used for both safety-related and non-safety-related software in the S-CORE project.

Inputs and outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Inputs: Software sources (C++), configuration files, dependencies
| Outputs: Object files, binaries, build logs

  QCC overview

Available information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Version: 8.x [1]_
- Official documentation: https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/index.html

Installation and integration
----------------------------
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~
To use QCC in a project, add the appropriate toolchain configuration to the `MODULE.bazel` file.

.. code-block:: Python

  # Configure the target toolchain.
  bazel_dep(name = "score_toolchains_qnx", version = "0.0.6", dev_dependency = True)

  toolchains_qnx = use_extension(
      "@score_toolchains_qnx//:extensions.bzl",
      "toolchains_qnx",
      dev_dependency = True,
  )
  toolchains_qnx.sdp(
      sha256 = "<SHA256_CHECKSUM>",
      strip_prefix = "installation",
      url = "https://www.qnx.com/<path_to>/installation.tgz",
  )
  use_repo(toolchains_qnx, "toolchains_qnx_sdp")
  use_repo(toolchains_qnx, "toolchains_qnx_qcc")

If your project uses multiple toolchains or configurations, update the `.bazelrc` file in the project root to reference the QCC toolchain.

.. code-block:: Python

  ...
  build:qnx_x86_64 --extra_toolchains=@toolchains_qnx_qcc//:qcc_x86_64
  ...

And during the build process, set appropriate configuration flags to select the QCC toolchain.

.. code-block:: bash

  bazel build --config=qnx_x86_64 //path/to:target


Bazel will automatically download the required dependencies and configure the QCC toolchain for your project as specified.

Detailed instructions for setting up QCC toolchain can be found in the S-CORE toolchains documentation, i.e. https://github.com/eclipse-score/toolchains_qnx


Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~
QCC is invoked by bazel as the C/C++ compiler for QNX targets.



Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
Requires linux and bazel build environment.

Result
------
QCC requires qualification for use in safety-related software development according to ISO 26262.


**Tool Qualification**
----------------------
Based on method: validation of the software tool.

Requirements and testing aspects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
QCC is a proprietary tool and has already been qualified by the tool provider.
For use in safety-related contexts, it is mandatory to follow the QCC safety manual and ensure that all relevant mitigations and user responsibilities described therein are fully applied.

.. [1] The tool version mentioned in this document is preliminary. It is subject to change and will be updated in future.
