GCC Compiler Verification Report
================================

Introduction
------------
Scope and purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GCC is open-source C/C++ compiler. Used for both safety-related and non-safety-related software in the S-CORE project.

Inputs and outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Inputs: Software sources (C++), configuration files, dependencies
| Outputs: Object files, binaries, build logs

  GCC overview

Available information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Version: 12.x [1]_
- Official repository: https://gcc.gnu.org/
- Official documentation: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/

Installation and integration
----------------------------
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~
To use QCC in a project, add the appropriate toolchain configuration to the `MODULE.bazel` file.

.. code-block:: Python

  # Configure the gcc toolchain.
  bazel_dep(name = "score_toolchains_gcc", version = "0.5", dev_dependency = True)

  gcc = use_extension("@score_toolchains_gcc//extentions:gcc.bzl", "gcc", dev_dependency = True)
  gcc.toolchain(
    sha256 = "<SHA256_CHECKSUM>",
    strip_prefix = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
    url = "https://github.com/eclipse-score/<path_to_gcc>/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu_gcc12.tar.gz",
  )
  use_repo(gcc, "gcc_toolchain", "gcc_toolchain_gcc")

If your project uses multiple toolchains or configurations, update the `.bazelrc` file in the project root to reference the QCC toolchain.

.. code-block:: Python

  ...
  common --extra_toolchains=@gcc_toolchain//:host_gcc_12
  ...

In this case default host toolchain is set to GCC and it will be used for all cc_* rules in the project.

Detailed instructions for setting up and tuning of GCC toolchain can be found in the S-CORE toolchains documentation, i.e. https://github.com/eclipse-score/toolchains_gcc

Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~
GCC is invoked by Bazel as the C/C++ compiler for host builds, unit tests and integration testing.

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
Requires Linux and Bazel build environment.

Result
------
GCC requires qualification for use in safety-related software development according to ISO 26262.


**Tool Qualification**
----------------------
Based on method: validation of the software tool.

Requirements and testing aspects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GCC is an open-source tool and has already been qualified by the tool provider in many environments. For use in safety-related contexts, it is mandatory to follow the GCC safety manual and ensure that all relevant mitigations and user responsibilities described therein are fully applied.

.. [1] The tool version mentioned in this document is preliminary. It is subject to change and will be updated in future.
